# Why

So the idea is to refactor the hell out of this project.

I'm planning on reworking everything almost from scratch, reimagining my design decisions. I sure see they were pretty poor, nonetheless fine for the first attempt, and good for the initial momentum.

I'm going to separate logic from graphics completely. 

# What we got right now

I will put a drawing or a graph of it here if or when I figure it out myself, but the essence is that most of code is unmanageable trash and should be rethought. Right now most things, especially Asset Management and Global control is total garbage. 

# First step

I'm going to write most of the code from scratch, probably starting from high-level stuff until the code feels good. 

The drawing methods need not be intermixed with other logic as to allow for possible change of the underlying graphics framework.
