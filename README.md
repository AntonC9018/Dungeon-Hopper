# Dungeon-Hopper

This project has grown way out of hand.
I'm scared of touching, reworking or refactoring anything, so I'm gonna abandon it, probably forever.

I kinda like some aspects of my implementation. 

It can be made manageable with refactoring. A LOT of refactoring.

Also animations and the complexity of logic need to be addressed. Right now they are not very structured.


# Perhaps

Perhaps some day when I have the will, I will do this game from scratch.
I feel like the abstractions in Corona don't befit me.
