`Tinkers` are functions that add handlers to the chains of an instance of an entity. They also may modify stats via the interaction with the DynamicStats handler.

This can be done manually too, but I hope these tinkers will provide an easier interface.

Not to be confused with `Retouchers`, which add handlers to the chain template of an entity class.
